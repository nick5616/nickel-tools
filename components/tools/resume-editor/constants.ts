\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, itemsep=1pt]
\item \textbf{[Action Verb]} [Accomplishment with quantifiable impact]. It takes this many words to write. Use as many words as you can fit within the line.
\item \textbf{[Action Verb]} [Leadership or collaboration example]. Be efficient with your language. Make your words easy to understand quickly.
\item \textbf{[Action Verb]} [Additional achievement or responsibility]. Add as many relavant details as you can fit within the line. Consider the context that the reader has. Consider the reader's knowledge of the industry.

\item \textbf{[Action Verb]} [Accomplishment with quantifiable impact]. It takes this many words to write. Use as many words as you can fit within the line. Consider the context that the reader has. Consider the reader's knowledge of the industry. If the reader is human, being concise and clear is key. If the reader is a robot, including the keywords it cares about is literally the only thing that matters.
\item \textbf{[Action Verb]} [Leadership or collaboration example]. Be efficient with your language. Know your reader. That includes understanding that the initial reader is an ATS screener robot checking for keywords. If you don't appease this "reader", a human will never see your resume.
\item \textbf{[Action Verb]} [Additional achievement or responsibility]. Add as many relavant details as you can fit within the line. Your resume will at least be ready by a robot. It may be read by a human. You have to write it for both. This genuinely does not make sense and shows a flaw within the hiring process.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, itemsep=1pt]
\item \textbf{[Action Verb]} [Accomplishment with quantifiable impact]. When forming a concise resume, consider getting as close to one lines, or two lines, or three lines. Consider the context that the reader has. Consider the reader's knowledge of the industry. If the reader is human, being concise and clear is key. If the reader is a robot, including the keywords it cares about is literally the only thing that matters.
\item \textbf{[Action Verb]} [Leadership or collaboration example]. A bad bullet point's last line takes up less than 70% of the total line. Know your reader. That includes understanding that the initial reader is an ATS screener robot checking for keywords. If you don't appease this "reader", a human will never see your resume.
